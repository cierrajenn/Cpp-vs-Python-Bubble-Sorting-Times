# Comparing C++ and Python Bubble Sort Times

## Summary of Project
The purpose of this project is to compare the amount of time it takes C++ and Python to bubble sort an unordered set of 1000 numbers. Therefore, there are two files: BubbleSort.py and BubbleSort.cpp, each of which contain their own Bubble Sorting method. Given C++ is a compiler language, Python begins the program, and calls to C++. `BubbleSort.py` is used to output the sorting updates after incrementing the sorting set by 100 numbers at a times. Once both languages have completed their bubble sort, Python's matplotlib is used to display the execution times for every increment in the form of a bar graph for easy comparison. Additionally, the bar graph is automatically saved as a file called 'BattleOfTheBubbleSorts.png.'

## Additional Notes
* In order to run this project, you may need to install matplotlib if you haven't already. 
* This project included starter code from Professor Lisa Dion at the University of Vermont. Specifically:
   *  `numbers.txt`: a text file with a list of 10,000 random integers (taken from random.org)
   * `BubbleSort.cpp`: a C++ source file that takes a command line argument for the number of integers to sort. Reads in that many integers from the file, sorts the numbers, and prints out the first and last ten integers from the sorted list to demonstrate that it worked properly.
   * `BubbleSort.py`: a Python source file that includes the main program."
